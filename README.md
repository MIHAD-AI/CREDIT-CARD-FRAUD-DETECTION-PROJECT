# CREDIT-CARD-FRAUD-DETECTION-PROJECT

**Introduction**

Credit card fraud is a major problem, with billions of dollars lost each year. Machine learning can be used to detect fraud by identifying patterns in transaction data that are indicative of fraud.

**Dataset**

The dataset used for this project is a publicly available dataset of credit card transactions from September 2013. The dataset contains 284,807 transactions, of which 492 are fraudulent.

**Machine Learning Algorithms**

The following machine learning algorithms were used to detect fraud in the dataset:

* ISOLATION FOREST TREE MODEL
* Support Vector Machine (SVM)
* RANDOM FOREST CLASSIFIER MODEL
*LOGISTIC REGRESSION MODEL
* DECISSION TREE CLASSIFIER MODEL
* NAIVE BAYES CLASSIFIER

**Results**

The results of the experiments showed that the Isolation Forest algorithm with PCA was the most effective algorithm for detecting fraud in the dataset. The algorithm achieved an accuracy of 99.3%, with a false positive rate of 0.1%.

**Limitations**

The project has a few limitations, including:

* The dataset is highly imbalanced, with the positive class (frauds) accounting for only 0.172% of all transactions.
* The project only uses a single dataset. It would be interesting to see how the results would change if the project used a different dataset.

**Future Work**

There are a few directions for future work, including:

* Applying the project to other datasets of credit card transactions.
* Investigating other machine learning algorithms for detecting fraud.
* Developing a web application that can be used to detect fraud in real time.

**Conclusion**

The project has shown that machine learning can be used to effectively detect credit card fraud. The results of the project can be used to improve the security of credit card transactions and protect consumers from fraud.
